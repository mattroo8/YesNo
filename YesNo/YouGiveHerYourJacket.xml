<scene name="YouGiveHerYourJacket" >
<!--First event-->
<event>You take off your Jacket and wrap it around her. You can see her breath like smoke rising through the air. "Where am I?" She asks. "Who are you?" You are not sure what to say, so you stay quiet and respond by tucking the jacket in under her back. Her shivering has slowed down and she tries to sit up. Do you help her?</event>

She has long dark hair and a slender figure. There are no signs of injury. You rock her back and forth until she comes to. Her skin is covered in goosebumps and she is shivering.
