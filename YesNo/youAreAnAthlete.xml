<!--First event-->
<event>You think to yourself, that you must be a sports professional of some kind. You leave the room and walk down the hallway and open the front door. You're out in the country side, the cool breeze ruffles your hair as you walk out into a bright spring day. There is a road which runs right passed the house and a barn yard a couple of yards from the house. Do you check out the barn yard?</event>
