<!--First event-->
<event>You leave Ben and run up the hall with the rest of the group. You turn the corner and end up in a large room which looks like the canteen of the barracks. You can hear Marie sobbing behind you. "We shouldn't have left him." "He sacrificed himself to save us" John replied. "He didn't want to die" said Marie. You walk down through the canteen and come to a door. It looks like the door to the kitchen. "We shouldn't go in there." said Marie. "There could be more in there" "Ya well they could come after us when they finish with Ben!" John snapped. Marie began to cry again. Do you open the door?</event>

<event>You agree with Marie. It's too risky and after all you are after weapons not food. You instead retrace your steps back through the canteen. As you walk past one of the tables, Marie's bag hits off of a cup which knocks it to the floor. The handle on the kitchen door starts to turn. Do you stick around to see what it is?</event>

<event>You slowly open the door. It creaks as it opens. The lights are off and its hard to see anything. The three of you move into the kitchen. There are bodies on the floor which you are careful to step over. Suddenly John lets out a scream. You turn to see Johns ankle held by a walker. He screams for help. Do you help him?</event>
