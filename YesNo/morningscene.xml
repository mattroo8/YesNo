<!--First event-->
<event>You wake up wet and cold. Your body aches all over. All you can see is darkness. You slowly sit up by pushing against the leaves and dirt underneath you. The moonlight reflects off of the surrounding trees. As you get to your feet you feel dizzy and unstable. You scope the surrounding area and see a dark mound five feet away...do you check it out?</event>

<event>You decide not to check it out but instead survey the ground around you where you first woke up. You come across a small rucksack which you pick up and begin to look through. There are a couple of chemistry books which you throw to the ground. You then find at the bottom of the bag a knife. Do you keep it?</event>

<!--Right child of the first event-->
<event>You slowly walk over to the dark mound. As you get closer you realise that it is a person. You get down on your knees to get a closer look. It's a women wearing a green dress. She has long dark hair and a slender figure. There are no signs of injury. You rock her back and forth until she comes to. Her skin is covered in goosebumps and she is shivering. Do you give her your jacket?</event>
